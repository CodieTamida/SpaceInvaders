# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.
In this milestone we refactored to code with unique_ptrs and added a clicking feature for projectiles
and also added a scoring system, as well, as a function to continually add opponents so the game continues until 
the player loses.
## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.
The biggest challenges of this milestone using the unique_ptr and the move() function.
## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?
This project has been fun, and has been a helpful resource in helping us apply all 
the concepts that we have learn, so far, in Object-Oriented Programming with the use
of constructors, inheritance, and pointers.
